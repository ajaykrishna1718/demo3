*In order to extract the tables from the pdf I have used a python package tabula.

*tabula can read the pdfs and extract the tables from it.

*There are even some other packages like camelot pyPDF pdfplumber to do this work.

*Trying all of those I found the tabula package to be more effective and efficent int extracting 
the tables from the pdf.

*Even though tabula does some really good work in extracting the tables from the specified pdfs,it
is not perfect.

*I found many mistakes in the tables extracted from pdfs using tabula which needs some additional
work either in spreasheets platform like excel or by python packages like pandas in order to 
make the table perfect.

*Every table extracted from a pdf needs some additional work as they are not perfect and contains
mistakes.


*I am unable to attach the pdfs I used to make this code and the csv files I extracted from the code
as it contains my personal details.Instead I am providing a common bank statement.

*But this code works on any pdf file and also needs some data manipulation as I mentioned eariler.

*In order to run this file one needs to have an environment where python along with packages like
tabula and pandas are installed.


Thank You.
